#  iOS Storybook Demo

This demo project is for the swift package [Storybook-SwiftUI](https://github.com/aj-bartocci/Storybook-SwiftUI). The project has the minimum version set to iOS 11, demonstrating that [Storybook-SwiftUI](https://github.com/aj-bartocci/Storybook-SwiftUI) can be used in projects that do not support SwiftUI (iOS 13+). 

It also makes use of the swift package [SwiftUIPreviewHelpers](https://github.com/aj-bartocci/SwiftUIPreviewHelpers) for bridging with UIKit views.
